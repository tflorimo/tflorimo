- 🧉 I work as a Ssr. Analyst Developer for a company in Buenos Aires, Argentina 

- 💻 My job consists in developing and mantaining our DMS and ERP systems, mostly creating new reports and features. The systems are quite old so my tasks also include a lot of code refactoring and maintenance, along with optimization and problem solving.

- 💾 Game Development: I've been involved since 2020 as **Senior Developer** in the development of a GTA V Roleplay public server which happens to be one of the most populars in Argentina. Through Cfx.re's FiveM application I've used the vRP, ESX and QBCore frameworks using **Lua**. This helped me with my frontend development skills, because I had to create graphical user interfaces using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS**.

- 🤓 I’m currently learning **Javascript for NodeJS backend development**

- 📝 This profile overview was created using this tool --> [✨click me!✨](https://github.com/rahuldkjain/github-profile-readme-generator)

- ⏩ I wish to learn **React.js**, so I can learn React Native to develop mobile applications. I look at frontend developers who create such amazing web apps and I want to be a part of that huge, "little" world.

- ✅ Strengths: I consider that my problem solving abilities, my patience and my understanding of MySQL databases are the most important skills that I have. And my love for coding, of course ❤️

- ⚠️ Weaknesses: It is my personal belief that we should all learn to accept our weaknesses. Frontend development, OOP programming, and creation of complex algorithms are my weaknesses.

- 💁‍♂️ Random fact about me: My first programming class was in 2015, I didn't understand a single thing about it so I ditched programming for 2 or 3 years. I suck at OOP programming, but hey, don't we all?
